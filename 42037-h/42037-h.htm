<h3>JOURNAL OF THE EXPENSES OF JOHN, KING OF FRANCE, IN ENGLAND, 1359-60.</h3>

  <p>Possibly some of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." may remember that King
  John II. of France was taken prisoner by Edward the Black Prince at the
  battle of Poitiers, fought September 20, 1356. If not, I would refer them
  to the delightful pages of old Froissart, where, in the version of Lord
  Berners, they will see chronicled at length,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"How Kyng John of Fraunce was taken prisoner at the Batayle of
  Poyeters; how the Englyshmen wan greatly thereat, and how the Prince
  conveyed the Frenche Kyng fro Burdeaux into Englande."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I am induced to bring under the notice of your readers a curious roll,
  containing one year's expenditure (July 1, 1359, to July 8, 1360)
  incurred by the French king during his captivity in England. This
  important document has been very recently printed in the <i>Comptes de
  l'Argenterie</i>, and edited from a MS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale by
  M. Douët d'Arcq for the <i>Société de l'Histoire de France</i>. It may
  perhaps be well to state, that after the battle of Poitiers the heroic
  Prince Edward conducted his royal prisoner to Bordeaux, where he remained
  till the end of April, 1357. On the 24th of May following they both made
  their entry into London, "the Frenche Kynge mounted on a large whyte
  courser well aparelled, and the Prince on a lytell blacke hobbey
  (<i>haquenée</i>) by hym." John was lodged at first at the Savoy Palace,
  but was removed shortly afterwards to Windsor Castle, at which place he
  was allowed to "go a huntynge and a haukynge at hys pleasure, and the
  lorde Phylyp his son with him." The document in question refers to the
  years 1359 and 1360, when the king was confined at Hertford Castle, at
  Somerton Castle in Lincolnshire, and lastly in the Tower of London. As
  this document, which is so intimately connected with a favourite portion
  of our history, has, I believe, received no notice from any English
  journal, and as it moreover affords many valuable illustrations of
  domestic manners, and of the personal character of the royal captive, I
  have made a few extracts from it for insertion in "N. &amp; Q.," in the
  <!-- Page 506 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  the numerous readers of that useful and entertaining work.</p>

<h3>WAY OF INDICATING TIME IN MUSIC.</h3>

  <p>The following rough mixture of Notes and Queries may serve to excite
  attention to the subject. The merest beginner is aware that the letter C,
  with a vertical line drawn through it, denotes <i>common time</i>; in
  which he will take the C for the first letter of <i>common</i>. The
  symbols of old music are four: the circle, the semicircle, and the two
  with vertical lines drawn through them. After these were written 2 or 3,
  according as the time was double or triple. And instead of a bar drawn
  through the circle or semicircle, a central point was sometimes inserted.
  All these are true facts, whether connected or unconnected, and whether
  any implication conveyed in any way of stating them be true or false. The
  C, with a line through it, certainly did not distinguish common time from
  triple. Alsted, in his <i>Encyclopædia</i> (1649), says that it means the
  <i>beginning of the music</i>; without any reference to time. Solomon de
  Caus, known as having had the steam-engine claimed for him, but who
  certainly wrote on music in 1615, found the circles, &amp;c. so variously
  used by different writers, that he abandons all attempt at description or
  reconciliation.</p>

  <p>May I suggest an origin for the crossed C? In the oldest church music,
  it often happens that the lines are made to begin with a vertical line
  impaling two lozenges, with a third lozenge between them, but on one
  side. It is as if in the three of diamonds the middle lozenge were
  removed a little to the left, the upper and lower ones sliding on a
  vertical line until they nearly touch the removed middle one. Now if this
  figure were imitated <i>currente calamo</i>, as in rapid writing, it
  would certainly become an angle crossed by a vertical line; which angle
  would perhaps be rounded, thus giving the crossed semicircle. Has this
  derivation been suggested? Or can any one suggest a better?</p>

  <p>But, it will be said, whence comes the full circle? It is possible
  that there may have happened in this case what has happened in others:
  namely, that a symbol invented, and firmly established, before the
  partial disuse of Latin, may have been extended in different ways by the
  vernacular writers of different countries. This has happened in the case
  of the words <i>million</i>, <i>billion</i>, <i>trillion</i>, &amp;c. The
  first, and the root of all, was established early, and while no
  vernacular works existed, and it has only one meaning. The others,
  certainly introduced at a later time, mean different things in different
  countries. May it not have been that the variety of usage which De Caus
  notes, may have arisen from different writers, ignorant of each other,
  choosing each his own mode of deriving other symbols from the crossed
  semicircle, obtained as suggested by me? I am fully aware of the risk of
  such suggestions&mdash;but they have often led to something better.</p>

  <p><i>A smart Saying of Baxter.</i>&mdash;In his <i>Aggravations of Vain
  Babbling</i>, speaking of gossips, Baxter says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If I had one to send to school that were sick of the talking
  evil&mdash;the <i>morbus loquendi</i>&mdash;I would give (as Isocrates
  required) a double pay to the schoolmaster willingly; one part for
  teaching him to hold his tongue, and the other half for teaching him to
  speak. I should think many such men and women half cured if they were
  half as weary of speaking as I am of hearing them. <i>He that lets such
  twattling swallows build in his chimney may look to have his pottage
  savour of their dung.</i>"</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Connexion of Cornwall and Ph&oelig;nicia.</i>&mdash;The
  effort to trace the ancient connexion of countries by the relics of their
  different customs, would be amusing if not useful. The fragment of the
  voyage of Hamilcar the Carthaginian confirms the trade of the
  Ph&oelig;nicians with Cornwall for tin. The Roman writers still extant
  confirm it. The traffic was carried on by way of Gades or Cadiz, the
  Carthaginians being the carriers for the Ph&oelig;nicians. In Andalusia
  to this day, middle-aged and old men are addressed <i>Tio</i>, or uncle;
  as <i>Tio Gorgè</i>, "Uncle George." This custom prevails in Cornwall
  also, and only there besides. Is not that a trace of the old intercourse?
  Again, clouted cream, known only in the duchy of Cornwall, which once
  extended as far as the river Exe in Devon, is only found besides in Syria
  and near modern Tyre, whence the same tin trade was carried on. These are
  curious coincidences. Many of the old Cornish words are evidently of
  Spanish origin: as <i>cariad</i>, <i>caridad</i>, charity or benevolence;
  <i>Egloz</i> or <i>Eglez</i>, a church; <i>Iglesia</i> or <i>Yglezia</i>,
  and many others, which seem to bear a relation to the same
  intercourse.</p>

  <p>The notice respecting the word <i>cot</i> or
  <i>cote</i>,&mdash;termination of proper names in a particular district
  in Cornwall,&mdash;already mentioned in these pages, supposed to be Saxon
  from the idea that its use was confined to one district, which I have
  shown to be a mistake, may be from the Cornish word <i>icot</i>, "below,"
  in place of the Saxon <i>cote</i> or <i>cot</i>, "cottage." Thus,
  <i>goracot</i> is probably from <i>gora</i> or <i>gorra</i>, and
  <i>icot</i>, i. e. "down below." <!-- Page 508 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page508"></a>{508}</span><i>Trelacot</i> from
  <i>Tre</i>, "a town," and <i>icot</i>, "below." The <i>l</i> was often
  prefixed for sound sake: as <i>lavalu</i> for <i>avalu</i>, "an apple;"
  <i>quedhan lavalu</i>, "an apple tree;" <i>Callacot</i>, from
  <i>cala</i>, or <i>calla</i>, "straw," and <i>icot</i>. The introduction
  of the vowel <i>a</i> for <i>i</i> might be a corruption in spelling
  after the sound. This is only surmise, but it has an appearance of
  probability.</p>

  <p><i>Portrait of John Rogers, the Proto-Martyr.</i>&mdash;Should you
  think the following minor Note interesting to your correspondent <span
  class="sc">Kt.</span>, perhaps you will find a corner for it in your
  miscellany.</p>

  <p>Living some time ago on the picturesque coast of Dorsetshire, I had
  the good fortune to have for a neighbour a lady of cultivated taste and
  literary acquirements; among other specimens of antiquity and art to
  which she drew my attention, was a portrait, in oil, of John Rogers; it
  was of the size called "Kit Cat," and was well painted. This portrait she
  held in great veneration and esteem, declaring herself to be (if my
  memory does not deceive me) a descendant of this champion of
  Christianity, whose name stands on the "muster roll" of the "noble army
  of martyrs."</p>

  <p>In case <span class="sc">Kt.</span> should wish to push his inquiries
  in this quarter, I inclose you the name and address of the lady above
  alluded to.</p>

  At pp. 94. and 97. he gives us, however, the "Uxor non est ducenda" and
  the "Uxor est ducenda" of the celebrated Walter Haddon; and that too
  without the slightest intimation that he himself was not their author. It
  is not, I think, fair for any man thus to shine in borrowed plumes, or at
  least transcribe verbatim, and without acknowledgment, from a writer so
  little known and old-fashioned as Haddon. Let me therefore give the

  <p><i>Stilts used by the Irish.</i>&mdash;We have all heard of the use of
  stilts by the shepherds of the Landes; but I have met with <i>only
  one</i> passage which speaks of their use in Ireland. I have crossed
  rivers, both in Scotland and in Ireland, on stilts, when the water was
  not deep, and have seen them kept instead of a ferryboat, when there was
  no bridge, but do not think they are in common use at the present day.
  The passage in question is quoted in Ledwich's <i>Antiquities</i>, p.
  300.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I had almost forgotten to notice a very remarkable particular
  recorded by Strada (Strada, <i>Belg.</i>, 1. viii. p. 404., Borlase's
  Reduction, 132.). He tells us that Sir Wm. Pelham, who had been Lord
  Justice of Ireland, led into the Low Countries in 1586 fourteen hundred
  wild Irish, clad only below the navel, and mounted on <i>stilts</i>,
  which they used in passing rivers: they were armed with bows and arrows.
  Having never met with this use of stilts among any other people, it
  seemed a matter of curiosity to notice it here."</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD "DEVIL."</h3>

  <p>What is the etymology of the word <i>devil</i>? This may appear an
  unnecessary question, since we have a regular chain of etyma, <span
  title="diabolos," class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&#x1F71;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;,</span>
  <i>diabolus</i>, <i>diavolo</i>, <i>devil</i>. But it is the first of
  this chain that puzzles me. I am aware that it is considered a
  translation of <span lang="he" class="heb" title="SAT`AN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5C2;&#x5B8;&#x5D8;&#x5B8;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>&#x200E;,
  and is derived usually from <span title="diaballein" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&alpha;&beta;&#x1F71;&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>,
  <i>calumniare</i>. But <span lang="he" class="heb" title="SAT`AN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5C2;&#x5B8;&#x5D8;&#x5B8;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>&#x200E;
  means <i>adversarius</i>, consequently the rendering would not be
  accurate. As the word in classical writers always means a false accuser,
  and never a supernatural agent of evil, I doubt the correctness of the
  usual derivations in the case of ecclesiastical usage; and am inclined to
  consider it one of the oriental words, in a Hellenistic dress, with which
  the Septuagint and Greek Testament are replete. Mr. Borrow, in
  <i>Lavengro</i>, instances as a reason for believing that divine and
  devilish were originally the same words, the similarity of the gypsy word
  <i>Un-debel</i>, God, and our word <i>devil</i>. Struck with this remark,
  on consideration of the subject, I perceived that there were several
  other coincidences of the same kind, as follows:&mdash;The Greek <span
  title="daimôn" class="grk">&delta;&alpha;&#x1F77;&mu;&omega;&nu;</span>
  means either a good or bad spirit of superhuman power. The Zend word
  <i>afrîtî</i>, "blessed," corresponds to the Arabic <i>afrît</i>, "a
  rebellious angel." The Latin <i>divus</i>, "a god," (and of course <span
  title="Dios" class="grk">&Delta;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, with all
  its variations,) belongs to the same family as the Persian <i>dîv</i>, "a
  wizard or demon;" while the <i>jin</i> or <i>jan</i> of the <i>Arabian
  Nights</i> answer to the forms <i>Zan</i>, <i>Zêna</i>, <i>Zeus</i>,
  <i>Janus</i>, <i>Djana</i> or <i>Diana</i>. All words denoting deified
  power, and employed by the inhabitants of Greece and Umbria.</p>

  <p>These singular resemblances may prove that fetish worship was more
  widely spread than is generally believed, and I think justify my doubts
  as to the etymology of the word in question.</p>

<h3>FORGED PAPAL SEAL.</h3>

  <p>An old seal was discovered some years ago by accident in the ruins of
  an abbey in the south of Ireland, of which the followings is a
  description. The workmanship is rude, the material a species of bronze.
  The impression consists of a circle of raised spots: on either side are
  two venerable human faces, both bearded; there is a rude cross between
  them. Above them are the letters&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"S - P - A - S - P - E."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 509 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page509"></a>{509}</span></p>

  <p>These are supposed to stand for "St. Paul" and "St. Peter." It is said
  that this seal was used for the purpose of affixing an impression to an
  instrument which pretended to be a Papal Bull: in fact, that it was used
  for forging Pope's Bulls. One of the objects of such forgeries (if they
  really occurred) would be, to grant dispensations for marriages on
  account of consanguinity. Some noble families in Ireland had very ancient
  Papal dispensations of this nature. It would often be convenient that
  extraordinary despatch should be used in obtaining a dispensation.</p>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents compare the seals on those
  dispensations with the above, or throw any light on the practice of
  dispensing with the ecclesiastical law against consanguineous
  marriages?</p>

<h3>SURNAMES.</h3>

  <p>I have to thank many of your readers who have favoured me with private
  letters on this subject since the printing of the prospectus of my
  <i>Dictionary of Surnames</i> in your columns; and before troubling you
  with a string of Queries, I would briefly refer to two or three points in
  the kind communications under this head in "N. &amp; Q." of May 1. E. H.
  Y. will find the question, <i>sur</i>name or <i>sir</i>name, slightly
  touched upon in my <i>English Surnames</i> (3rd edit., vol. i. p. 13.),
  and argued at length in the <i>Literary Gazette</i> for Nov. 1842, in a
  correspondence originating out of a notice of the first edition of my
  book. I think the balance of evidence is in favour of <i>sur</i>name;
  that is, a name superadded to the personal or baptismal appellation,
  which applies with equal propriety to the sobriquets given to monarchs
  and distinguished men, and to the hereditary designations of people of
  humble rank. Alexander <i>Mitchell</i>, your groom, is no other than
  Alexander the Great; and Bill <i>Rowse</i>, your errand-boy, is the
  namesake of the Red King who fell in the New Forest; the only difference
  being, that the plebeians inherit their second name from their ancestors,
  while the magnates enjoy theirs by exclusive right. I do not think,
  therefore, that the distinction contended for by E. H. Y. is either
  necessary or desirable: indeed I consider <i>sire</i>name as a mere play
  upon a mis-spelt word. In saying this, I would by no means disparage your
  excellent correspondent, whose communications I always read with pleasure
  I might add, that the distinction of "nomen patris additum proprio,"
  <i>sire</i>name, and "nomen supra nomen additum," surname, is by no means
  new.</p>

  <p>I cannot quite agree with E. S.'s suggestion as to the desirableness
  of omitting the names derived from Christian names, this being one of the
  most interesting branches of my inquiry. I have already shown that from
  ten to thirty family names are occasionally found to proceed from
  <i>one</i> baptismal appellation; and at least half a dozen of the names
  to which E. S. calls my attention for explanation are so derived. To the
  termination <i><span class="nw">-cock</span></i>, occurring in so many
  names, I have already given attention, and the result may be seen in
  <i>Eng. Surn.</i>, vol. i. pp. 160. to 165., both inclusive.</p>

  <p>To the surnames derived from extinct or provincial words designating
  employments, I am paying considerable attention; but although I am
  tolerably well acquainted with our mediæval writers, and their
  glossarists, there are many names ending in <i>er</i> (generally having
  in old records the prefix <i>le</i>), which have hitherto baffled my
  etymological skill.</p>

  <p>W. L.'s remarks support the statements made in <i>Eng. Surn.</i>, vol.
  i., p. 38. <i>et seq.</i>, to show that family names have scarcely become
  hereditary, in some parts of England, even now, in the middle of the
  nineteenth century. Without occupying your valuable space unduly, I would
  now submit the following Queries:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. What book gives any rational account of the origin of the Scottish
  clans, and their distinctive or family names? I know Buchanan's work, but
  it gives very little information of the kind desired. <i>Any</i>
  authentic particulars regarding Scottish names will be acceptable.</p>

  <p>2. What is the real meaning of <i>worth</i>, which forms the final
  syllable of so many surnames? I have seen no less than six explanations
  of it, which cannot all be correct.</p>

  <p>3. Are there any works (besides dictionaries) in the Dutch, German,
  and Scandinavian languages which would throw light upon the family names
  of this country?</p>

  <p>4. What is the best compendious gazetteer or topographical dictionary
  of Normandy extant?</p>

  <p>5. Is anything known of a collection of surnames made by Mr. Cole, the
  antiquary, in the last century? It is mentioned in Collet's <i>Relics of
  Literature</i>, 1823. <!-- Page 510 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page510"></a>{510}</span></p>

  <p>6. Can any reader of "N. &amp; Q." explain the following surnames,
  which are principally to be found so early as the reign of Edward
  I.?&mdash;Alfox, Colfox, Astor, Fricher, Grix, Biber, Bakepuz, Le
  Chalouner, Le Cayser, Le Cacherel, Trelfer, Metcalfe, Baird, Aird,
  Chagge, Le Carun, at Bight.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Owen, Bishop of St. Asaph.</i>&mdash;To what family belonged John
  Owen, Bishop of St. Asaph, mentioned in Winkle's <i>Cathedrals</i> with
  so much honour? His father Owen Owen was Archdeacon of Anglesea, rector
  of Burton Latymer. I cannot find either name in the printed pedigrees of
  the various families of Owen, nor in such of the Harl. MSS. as I had time
  to examine. Wanted, the bishop's arms and crest, and any reference to his
  pedigree. It is said by Winkle that his monument is under the episcopal
  throne in St. Asaph's cathedral. He died 1651, and his father 1592.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Ursula.</span></p>

  <p><i>St. Wilfrid's Needle in Yorkshire</i>,&mdash;"where they used to
  try maids, whether they were honest." (<i>Burton.</i>) Does this stone
  exist? "Ancient writers do not mention," says Lingard, "Stonehenge,
  Abury, &amp;c., as appendages to <i>places of worship</i> among the
  Celtæ," therefore may it not be that these remains of antiquity were
  devoted to vain superstitions of the ignorant people, if not to gloomy
  rites of the officiating priests of the British Druids? The gigantic
  obelisks of single stones, called the "Devil's Arrows," near
  Boroughbridge, and the assemblage of rocks called Bramham Crags, a few
  miles north-west of Ripon, are considered to have been Druidical. Is St.
  Wilfrid's either of these? and can farther information about this rock be
  afforded?</p>

  <p class="author">B. B.</p>

  <p><i>Governor of St. Christopher in 1662.</i>&mdash;Will any one be so
  kind as to inform me who was the governor of the island of St.
  Christopher in the year 1662? I have an original, but unsigned letter,
  from him to the contemporary Dutch governor of St. Martin's, demanding
  reparation for an outrage of most extraordinary nature. He complains that
  the Dutch had seized and <i>reduced to slavery</i> the crew and
  passengers of an English ship during a time of peace. Is anything known
  of this affair, or is there any means of discovering the names of the
  colonial governors of that age? The letter is dated Sept. 1, 1662, and is
  endorsed, "A Coppie of my letter to the Gov. of St. Martin's."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Ursula.</span></p>

  <p><i>The Amber Witch.</i>&mdash;I am anxious to learn whether this be a
  pure fiction or a genuine document dressed up. Its strongest appearance
  of authenticity arises from the tedious pedantry of the ancient Lutheran
  pastor, its supposed author, which not only renders the perusal heavy,
  but also lets in various things unsuited to the decorum of modern
  manners. If a pure forgery, my inquiry extends to <i>the motives</i> of a
  fabrication, tedious to both reader and writer.</p>

  <p class="author">A. N.</p>

  <p><i>Coffins for General Use.</i>&mdash;In the parish church of
  Easingwold, Yorkshire, there was within the last few years an old
  <i>oaken shell</i> or <i>coffin</i>, asserted to have been used by the
  inhabitants for the interment of their dead. After the burial, the coffin
  was again deposited in the church. Are there any other well-authenticated
  instances of a similar usage? And do the words of the rubric in the Order
  for "the Burial of the Dead," "When they come to the grave, while the
  corpse is <i>made ready to be laid</i> <span class="sm">INTO</span>
  <i>the earth</i>," render it probable that such a custom was generally
  prevalent in the Anglican church <i>since</i> the Reformation?</p>

  <p>I have met with one corroborative circumstance, in which numbers of
  bodies were disinterred in a piece of ground <i>supposed</i> to have been
  consecrated, and not a vestige of a coffin was found.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Incognitus.</span></p>

  <p><i>The Surname Bywater.</i>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents
  furnish me with particulars relating to the surname "<i>Bywater</i>?"</p>

  <p>The earliest period from which I can trace it <i>direct</i> to the
  present day, and then only by family tradition, is about the close of the
  seventeenth century, or say 1680, about which time "&mdash;&mdash;
  Bywater" married Miss Witham, and resided at Towton Hall, near Tadcaster,
  Yorkshire, a place celebrated as being the field of a battle fought
  between the York and Lancaster forces on Palm Sunday, 1461.</p>

  <p>Stow mentions, in his <i>Survey</i>, that "<i>John Bywater</i>" was a
  Sheriff of London in 1424.</p>

  <p>Perhaps some of your readers, in Yorkshire or elsewhere, can throw a
  light on the subject, or can refer me to a book or MS. where information
  may be obtained?</p>

  <p><i>Robert Forbes.</i>&mdash;I should be glad if any of your
  correspondents could furnish me with any particulars relative to this
  talented and eccentric individual. He was the author of <i>The Dominie
  Deposed</i>, in the Buchan dialect. On the title-page of that piece he is
  described as "Robert Forbes, A.M., Schoolmaster of Peterculter," near
  Aberdeen. On application, however, to the Session Clerk of Peterculter,
  that functionary states that no such person was ever schoolmaster of that
  parish. Be this as it may, Forbes was obliged to leave Scotland on
  account of an intrigue, which he has humorously described in his
  <i>Dominie Deposed</i>. He appears to have removed to London, where he
  commenced the business of a hosier, in a shop on Tower Hill, at the sign
  of the "Book." Here he composed that <!-- Page 511 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page511"></a>{511}</span>celebrated travestie on
  the <i>Speech of Ajax to the Grecian Chiefs</i>, also in the Buchan
  dialect:</p>

  <p>I think Forbes states that his place of business on Tower Hill was
  "hard by the shop of Robbie Mill." (See Chalmers' <i>Life of

  <p><i>Alteration in Oxford Edition of the Bible.</i>&mdash;In the
  stereotype edition of the Bible, in 8vo., printed at Cambridge, for the
  British and Foreign Bible Society, I find the word <i>Judah</i>, 2 Chron.
  xxi. 2., substituted for <i>Israel</i>. This latter word is the reading
  of every copy of the authorized English version that I have been able to
  consult, including the 12mo. edition printed for the British and Foreign
  Bible Society at Oxford.</p>

  <p>No doubt <i>Judah</i> is the right word in this passage. The context
  requires it; and it is the reading of forty Hebrew MSS., and of all the
  ancient versions, except the Chaldee. It is also the reading of the old
  English version by Coverdale. But it has not been adopted by King James's
  translators. How has this deviation from their text crept into an edition
  emanating from a University press?</p>

  entered on the 10th of April, 1594, and I have reason to believe that the
  office had been vacant for about a year. But I can find no notice of Sir
  Gilbert's death. He was a member of Gray's Inn; admitted in 1537,
  barrister 1539, ancient 1547, reader 1554, serjeant 1558,
  attorney-general 1559, Master of the Rolls 1581; and during the interval
  between the death of Lord Chancellor Hatton (Nov. 22, 1591) and the
  appointment of Lord Keeper Puckering (May 28, 1592) one of the
  commissioners for hearing causes in chancery.</p>

  <p>"John Smyth, of Nibley, ancestor to the present proprietor, was very

  Dugdale abridged and published in his <i>Baronage of England</i>. In
  three other folio MSS. he has registered with great exactness <i>the
  names of the lords of manors in the county in the year 1608</i>, <i>the
  number of men in each parish able to bear arms, with their names, age,
  stature, professions, armour, and weapons</i>. <i>The sums each
  landholder paid to subsidies granted in a certain year</i> are set down
  in another MS. He likewise committed to writing a very particular account
  of the customs of the several manors in the hundred of Berkeley, and
  <i>the pedigrees of their respective lords</i>. These and some other

  <p><i>Proclamations to prohibit the Use of Coal, as Fuel, in

  three separate proclamations were issued for this purpose, and that it
  was at last made a capital offence; and a man was actually accused,
  tried, condemned, and executed for burning coal within the metropolis.
  Now what I want to ascertain relative to the above facts, is: 1. The date
  of each; 2. Any particulars that you or any of your correspondents may be
  kind enough to furnish; 3. The name, and station, trade, or profession of
  the person so executed.</p>

  <p>As Dr. Bachoffner has now often reiterated the above statement at the
  Polytechnic, and as it has always been received (at least when I have
  been there) with acclamations of surprise, I have no doubt that the
  particulars will interest many of your readers.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Arthur C. Wilson.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We have not been able to find any account of the execution for
  burning coal noticed by Dr. Bachoffner, which probably took place during
  the reign of Edward I., when the use of coal was prohibited by
  proclamation at London in the year 1306. These proclamations are noticed
  in Prynne's <i>Animadversions on the Fourth Part of Sir Edward Coke's
  Institutes</i>, p. 182., where it is said, that "in the latter part of
  the reign of Edward I., when brewers, dyers, and other artificers using
  great fires, began to use sea-coals instead of dry wood and charcoal, in
  and near the city of London, the prelates, nobles, commons, and other
  people of the realm, resorting thither to parliaments, and upon other
  occasions, with the inhabitants of the city, Southwark, Wapping, and East
  Smithfield, complained thereof twice one after another to the king as a
  public nuisance, corrupting the air with its stink and smoke, to the
  great prejudice and detriment of their health. Whereupon the king first
  prohibited the burning of sea-coal by his proclamation; which being
  disobeyed by many for their private lucre, the king upon their second
  complaint issued a commission of Oyer and Terminer to inquire of all such
  who burned sea-coals against his proclamation within the city, or parts
  adjoining to it, and to punish them for their first offence by great
  fines and ransoms; and for the second offence to demolish their furnaces,
  kilns wherein they burnt sea-coals, and to see his proclamation strictly
  observed for times to come, as the Record of 35 Edw. I. informs us." On
  this subject our correspondent should consult Edington's <i>Treatise on
  the Coal Trade</i>; Ralph Gardiner's <i>England's Grievance discovered in
  Relation to the Coal Trade</i>; and Anderson's <i>Origin of

<h3>ADDISON AND HIS HYMNS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 439.)</p>

  <p>Any attempt to divorce Addison from his hymns in the <i>Spectator</i>,
  and to ascribe them to any other writer, is so great a wrench to the
  feelings of a sexagenarian like myself, that the question must at once be
  set at rest.</p>

  <p>In reply to J. G. F.'s inquiry, these hymns, or a portion of them,
  were claimed for Andrew Marvell by Captain Edward Thompson, the editor of
  Marvell's works; but a writer in Kippis's edition of the <i>Biographia
  Britannica</i> remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We shall content ourselves with observing, that any man who can
  suppose that the ease, eloquence, and harmony of the ode, 'The Spacious
  Firmament,' &amp;c., could flow from Marvell's pen, must be very
  deficient in taste and judgment."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This claim on Captain Thompson's part was to have been considered
  under the article "Marvell," but the second edition of the
  <i>Biographia</i> did not, as we well know, extend beyond the letter
  F.</p>

  <p>But though we cannot concede these hymns to Marvell, he must not be
  underrated. His downright honesty of character and purpose must ever
  excite respect. His biographer strangely introduces him to us as "A witty
  droll in the seventeenth century, the son of a facetious gentleman at
  Hull." In one respect he resembled our gifted essayist; his style in
  prose was so captivating that we are told</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"From the King down to the Tradesman, his <i>Rehearsal Transposed</i>
  was read with great pleasure; he had all the men of wit on his side."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To return to the hymns and the just claims of Addison to the whole of
  them.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 453., Addison says,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have <i>already</i> communicated to the public some pieces of
  divine poetry, and as they have met with a very favourable reception,
  <i>I shall from time to time publish any work of the same nature which
  has not yet appeared in print</i>, and may be acceptable to my
  readers."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Then follows the hymn "When all Thy Mercies," &amp;c. Coming from such
  a man as Addison, this <!-- Page 514 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page514"></a>{514}</span>must be considered as pretty strong
  evidence of authorship.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 441., when introducing the hymn "The Lord
  my Pasture," &amp;c., Addison observes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As the poetry of the original is very exquisite, I shall present my
  readers with the following translation of it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With respect to this composition Bishop Hurd remarks, that
  Addison's</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"True judgment suggested to him that what he drew from Scripture was
  best preserved in a pure and simple expression, and the fervour of his
  piety made that simplicity pathetic."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>No doubt seems to have crossed the Bishop's mind as to the authorship.
  Sometimes Addison thought fit to throw a little mystery over these hymns.
  In <i>Spectator</i>, No. 489., after alluding to Psalm cvii. v. 23.,
  "They that go down to the sea," &amp;c. (which Addison says gives a
  description of a ship in a storm, preferable to any other that he has met
  with), he subjoins his "divine Ode made by a <i>Gentleman</i> on the
  conclusion of his travels," "How are Thy servants blest," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The verses 4 to 8 are said to refer to the storm which Allison himself
  encountered on the Mediterranean, after he embarked at Marseilles in
  1700.</p>

  <p>The hymn "When rising from the bed of death," <i>Spectator</i>, No.
  513, "a thought in sickness," is contained in a supposed letter from a
  <i>Clergyman</i>, viz. one of the club, "who assist me in my
  speculations."</p>

  <p>Tickell, in his exquisite elegy, so worthy of its subject, when
  asking,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"What new employments please the unbody'd mind?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>adds,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Or mixed with milder cherubim to glow,</p>
      <p>In <i>hymns of love, not ill essayed below</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Were not the very hymns which we are speaking of in Tickell's
  mind?</p>

  <p>Addison's piety, we may well gather from his writings, was, as Mr.
  Macaulay observes, of a cheerful character. The feeling which
  predominates in all his devotional papers, is that of gratitude; do we
  not find it also strikingly developed in his hymns? We all remember the
  beautiful lines,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ten thousand thousand precious gifts</p>
      <p class="i1">My daily thanks employ,</p>
      <p>Nor is the least a cheerful heart,</p>
      <p class="i1">That tastes those gifts with joy."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Let Bishop Ken and Addison retain their divine hymns&mdash;dear as
  they are, and let us hope ever will be, to man, woman, and
  child&mdash;whilst the English language is read or spoken. How greatly is
  their sublimity heightened, and their beauty enhanced, when we associate
  with them the purity of character and the assemblage of virtues which
  distinguished their excellent authors!</p>

<h3>WITCHCRAFT&mdash;MRS. HICKES AND HER DAUGHTER.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 394.)</p>

  <p>The particulars your correspondent asks for have not been furnished;
  but on what authority, <i>to move the previous question</i>, does the
  alleged fact of such a trial and execution at Huntingdon in 1716 for
  witchcraft, stated by Mr. Wills, and adopted by the <i>Quarterly
  Rev.</i>, rest? Mr. Wills (<i>Sir Roger de Coverley</i>, Notes, p. 126.)
  mentions also the execution of two women at Northampton for witchcraft
  just before the <i>Spectator</i> began to be published (March 1,
  1710-11), but gives no reference to any original source to support his
  statement. On the other hand, Hutchinson, the first edition of whose
  <i>Essay concerning Witchcraft</i> was published in 1718, and the second
  in 1720, who gives a chronological table of facts, informs us that the
  last execution in England for witchcraft was that at Exeter of Susan
  Edwards, Mary Trembles, and Temperance Lloyd in 1682 (vid. <i>Essay</i>,
  p. 41., 1st edit.). He was too painstaking a writer to be in ignorance of
  cases which had occurred so recently; and he had the assistance, in
  collecting his materials, of the two chief justices Parker and King, and
  Chief Baron Bury, to whom the work is dedicated. Through their means he
  must have been informed of what had taken place on the circuits, if any
  cases of witchcraft on which convictions had arisen had actually come
  before the judges. When it is remembered what attention was directed to
  the trial of Jane Wenham in 1712, who, though condemned, was not
  executed, and on whose case a great number of pamphlets were written, it
  can scarcely be supposed that in four years after two persons, one only
  nine years old (I take the account in Mackay's <i>Popular Delusions</i>,
  vol. iii.), should have been tried and executed for witchcraft without
  public attention being called to the circumstance. I may add that in the
  <i>Historical Register</i> for 1716, which notices in the domestic
  occurrences all trials of interest, there is no mention of such a case;
  and that in two London newspapers for 1716, which I have in a complete
  series, though enumerating other convictions on the circuit, I have
  equally searched without success. As it is a matter of considerable
  historical interest to ascertain accurately when the last execution for
  witchcraft took place in England, I should be glad if any of your
  correspondents would refer me to the authority on which the statements of
  the trials circ. 1710 and in 1716 are founded. Mr. Wright, I observe,
  does not notice them, and his words are&mdash;</p>

  <p>This work, although published in six languages, and several times
  reprinted, adorned with a hundred exquisite engravings, and portrait of

<h3>THE HEAVY SHOVE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 416.)</p>

  <p>Like your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Clark</span>, I too have
  kept a sharp look-out for this curious piece ascribed to Baxter; but
  having been unable to track it, I had long since come to the conclusion
  that its existence was apocryphal.</p>

  <p>The Rev. James Graves, in his <i>Spiritual Quixote</i>, written to
  ridicule Moravians and Methodists, notes it "as a very good book of old
  Baxter's," among several others of questionable identity, forming the
  library of Geoffrey Wildgoose's grandmother.</p>

  <p>When we recollect the temptation offered in the quaint and uncouth
  titles of the old Presbyterians, we can hardly wonder at their enemies
  improving upon them; and in this way, it appears to me, we are to account
  for the respectable name of Baxter being popularly attached to a book
  which everybody talks about, but which nobody has seen.</p>

  <p>It is again mentioned by Richard Cooksey, in his <i>Life of Lord
  Somers</i>, Worcester, 1791, and, taking its existence for granted, the
  author is astonished that Baxter, whom he extols to the skies, "could so
  far condescend to the temper and debased humour of the times as to
  entitle one of his tracts <i>A Shove</i>, &amp;c. Commenting upon this,
  Wilson, in his <i>History of Dissenting Churches</i>, London, 1808, is
  the next who alludes to the book in question, but merely to shift its
  authorship from "the famous Richard Baxter of Kidderminster" to a more
  obscure individual of the same name,&mdash;described as "an elder (in
  1692) of the Particular Baptist congregation worshipping in Winchester
  House." Of this person he says, "I know nothing excepting that he appears
  to have been a Fifth Monarchy man, and to have been far gone in
  enthusiasm."</p>

  <p>Although thus doubting that the author of the <i>Saints' Rest</i>
  wrote such a book as that described, I <!-- Page 516 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page516"></a>{516}</span>do not deny that there
  is a piece bearing the title in existence; but upon it the name of
  "<i>William</i> Bunyan" figures as the author. A copy of this was in the
  Theological Portion of the late Mr. Rodd's books, sold by Sotheby &amp;
  Co. in 1850, and bears the imprint of "London, 1768." This, I am inclined
  to think, is the only <i>Shove</i> <span class="sc">Mr. Clark</span> is
  likely to meet with; and although I can give no further account of it, I
  am disposed to consider it the spurious catchpenny of some ignorant
  scoffer, who, taking his <i>cue</i> from Graves, or rather from some
  earlier writer who has noticed it, thought it would be a good
  <i>spec.</i>, and therefore launched into the world <i>his</i>
  "<i>Effectual Shove</i>."</p>

<h3>GROUND ICE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 370.)</p>

  <p>Your Querist J. C. E. is informed that the singular phenomenon of the
  formation of ice in the beds of running rivers has not escaped the notice
  of scientific observers. M. Arago has devoted a paper to its
  investigation in the <i>Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes</i> for 1832 or
  1833, in which he specifies the rivers in which it has been observed.
  Indeed, although from its nature it is likely to escape notice, it is
  probably of not infrequent occurrence. Ireland, in his <i>Picturesque
  Views of the Thames</i>, quoting Dr. Plot, speaks of the subaqueous ice
  of that river. Colonel Jackson, in the fifth volume of the <i>Journal of
  the Royal Geographical Society</i>, alludes to its formation in the Neva,
  in a paper on the congelation of that river; and in the following volume
  of the same Journal is an article by Mr. Weitz, especially devoted to the
  ground ice of the rivers of Siberia. More recently, Mr. Eisdale has
  contributed the result of his researches upon the same subject to the
  <i>Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal</i>, vol. xvii.; and, finally, Dr.
  Farquharson has made public his observations upon the ground-gru of the
  rivers Don and Leochal, in Lincolnshire, in the <i>Philosophical
  Transactions</i> for 1835. There is also an article on the subject in one
  of the later volumes of the <i>Penny</i> or <i>Saturday</i>
  Magazines.</p>

  <p>That bodies of running, water, the surface of which solidifies when
  exposed to a diminished temperature, should have a tendency to congelate
  in their sheltered depths, seems an anomaly which demands inquiry and
  explanation; and accordingly each of the above-mentioned writers has
  raised an hypothesis more or less probable, to account for the
  phenomenon. Dr. Farquharson would attribute it to the radiation of heat
  from the bottom, as dew is formed by radiation from the surface of the
  earth; but a consideration of the supervening obstacles to
  radiation&mdash;a body of moving water thickly coated with ice and even
  snow&mdash;destroys the plausibility of his theory. That of Mr. Eisdale,
  that the frozen <i>spiculæ</i> of the atmosphere falling into the water
  become <i>nuclei</i>, around which the water at the bottom freezes, seems
  merely frivolous. The explanation of M. Arago is more satisfactory, viz.
  that the lower currents of water being less rapid in motion than those
  intermediate, or at the surface, congelation may be expected at a lower
  temperature (say 32° Fahr.), the process of crystallisation being
  favoured by the pebbles, fragments of wood, and the uneven surface of the
  river's bed. After all, however, the phenomenon has been but imperfectly
  investigated under its various manifestations, and its real cause
  probably remains yet to be discovered.</p>

<h3>CHARACTER OF ALGERNON SYDNEY.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., pp. 426. 447.)</p>

  <p>Your two correspondents C. E. D. (p. 426.) and C. (p. 447.) appear to
  have read <span class="sc">Mr. Hepworth Dixon's</span> Query about
  Algernon Sydney either very hastily or very carelessly. Yet it seems to
  me plain enough. There is not one word in it about Barillon or Dalrymple;
  no inquiry about the home life of Sydney. As every one knows a great part
  of his time was spent abroad, it is probable <span class="sc">Mr.
  Dixon</span> thinks that anecdotes and allusions to so conspicuous a
  person may occur in the cotemporary letters and memoirs of France,
  Germany, Italy, &amp;c., and he asks for references to any such anecdotes
  or allusions as may have fallen in the way of readers of "N. &amp; Q."
  Surely this is explicit. But what has Dalrymple or Mr. Croker to say in
  answer to a question about Sydney's way of life when abroad? That, as I
  take it, was the point, and a general discussion as to the character of
  the author of the <i>Discourses on Government</i> is <i>à-propos</i> of
  nothing. As the subject has been opened, and as I know of none more
  interesting in the whole range of English history, I cannot refrain from
  at least entering one protest against C.'s description of the
  "illustrious patriot" as a "corrupt traitor of the worst class."</p>

  <p>That <span class="sc">Mr. Dixon</span> is not single in his admiration
  of the character of Sydney I could quote many "instances," from our late
  prime minister downwards. But the title "illustrious" can scarcely be
  denied to a man who, besides being of the best blood in England, played a
  leading part in the Revolution, and was one of the closest thinkers and
  most masculine writers our language has to show. What makes a man
  illustrious? Birth, commanding position, intellect, learning, literary
  genius? Sydney had them all. But C. thinks <!-- Page 517 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page517"></a>{517}</span>he ought not to be
  called a patriot. What, do his wisdom and moderation in the civil war;
  his opposition to the extreme measures of Cromwell; his long solitary
  exile; his glorious death, count for nothing? There is, however, the
  charge of taking money from the King of France. No doubt this is a very
  "curious case," and I too shall be anxious to see "what light <span
  class="sc">Mr. Dixon</span> may be able to throw on it." The accusation
  rests on the sole authority of Dalrymple; and Dalrymple is <i>not</i> a
  man who can be taken on his mere word. He was a violent partisan. He
  hated the Whigs, and is convicted of having suppressed the truth, when it
  suited his party or his passions to misrepresent. The Barillon
  Correspondence should be again examined, and, if possible, further
  particulars of the money payments to our party leaders obtained.</p>

<h3>MONUMENT TO THE MEMORY OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS AT ANTWERP.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 415.)</p>

  <p>Having visited the interesting city of Antwerp in the autumn of 1846,
  I can answer the Query of your correspondent C. E. D. from personal
  inspection. The monument to Mary Queen of Scots is still in existence;
  and consists of a richly ornamented slab, placed at a considerable height
  from the pavement, against a pillar in (I think) the southern transept of
  the church of St. Andrew. I was told on the spot that it was erected by
  two English ladies, but my informant was silent as to the tradition
  respecting the head. In the centre of the carvings which adorn the upper
  part of the monument, is inserted a medallion portrait of the beautiful
  but unfortunate queen; it is extremely well painted, and represents her
  in that peculiar costume so familiar to those acquainted with her
  accustomed style of dress. I inclose a copy of the
  inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ac">"<span class="sc">Maria Stuarta</span>,<br/>

  <p>The wood-carvings, with which this church abounds (especially those of
  the pulpit and its accessories), are marvellous efforts of Art.</p>

  <p class="author">M. W. B.</p>

  <p>Having visited the church of St. Andrew at Antwerp during the autumn
  of last year, I am able to inform your correspondent C. E. D. (Vol. v.,
  p. 415.) that the monument to which he alludes still exists.</p>

  <p>The portrait of Mary Queen of Scots is above the tablet, which was, I
  believe, erected to the memory of Elizabeth Curle; who, after the
  execution of her mistress, resided at Antwerp, and was buried in that
  church.</p>

  <p class="author">F. H.</p>

  <p>The monument dedicated to the memory of their beloved mistress by the
  two noble ladies of the household of Mary Queen of Scots, Lady Barbara
  Mowbray, the wife, and Elizabeth Curle, the sister, of Gilbert Curle, the
  queen's confidential secretary, still exists in the church of St. Andrew
  at Antwerp. The history, or rather <i>story</i> of the decapitated head
  having been borne away by these ladies, and buried at the foot of the
  pillar on which the monument is placed, which is alluded to by your
  correspondent, is too apocryphal for belief. There is no reason to
  suppose that any <i>head</i> of the queen was carried away by these
  devoted women into exile, excepting in the shape of her portrait painted
  on copper; which, instead of being interred <i>beneath</i> the monument,
  is still to be seen placed above the dedicatory inscription. It is true
  that in the edition of Descamps' <i>Voyage Pittoresque de la Flandre</i>,
  published at <i>Paris</i> and <i>Rouen</i> in 1769, it is stated that the
  monument was surmounted by "<i>son buste en marbre</i>;" but this error
  was corrected in the <i>Antwerp</i> edition of 1792, where it is
  correctly affirmed to be "<i>son portrait peint</i>."</p>

  <p>Mention is made of this crowned portrait, of a circular form, in
  Mackie's <i>Castles and Prisons of Queen Mary</i>, and of the close
  resemblance it bears to another in the possession of Lady Cathcart; who
  assured Mr. Mackie that the two portraits were painted by order of the
  queen, and presented by her to <i>two Scottish ladies</i>, but whose
  names are not mentioned.</p>

  <p>The following epitaph to the memory of these two faithful servants of
  the unhappy queen, has also been preserved by Jacques Le Roy in his
  <i>Théâtre Sacré du Brabant</i>, tom. ii. p. 90. It was copied by him
  from a blue marble slab placed over the entrance to the vault in which
  they were deposited:&mdash;</p>

  of the queen; and, lastly, how he came to be pardoned, and what became of
  him afterwards? She declared, in her last hours, that <i>he was the cause

<h3>LORD KING; THE SCLATERS; DR. KELLET, ETC.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 457.)</p>

  <p>If <span class="sc">Balliolensis</span> wishes for a more particular
  account of the Sclater family than that which follows, I shall be happy
  to correspond with him upon the subject.</p>

  <p><i>Anthony Sclater, D.D.</i>, was vicar of Leighton Buzzard for fifty
  years, and died, aged 100, about 1620. His son&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>William Sclater, D.D.</i>, Fellow of King's, and vicar of
  Pitminster in Somersetshire, is the person mentioned by Dr. Kellet. He
  was an exceedingly learned man, and the author of many theological works
  (for a list, see <i>Bib. Bod. Cat.</i>), some of which were published
  after his death, <i>which occurred in 1627</i>. There is a curious and
  interesting account of him in Fuller's <i>Worthies</i>, vol. i. p. 119.
  (see also <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i>). His son&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>William Sclater, also D.D. and Fellow of King's</i>, was vicar of
  Collumpton, Devon, and prebend of Exeter, and appears to have kept up by
  several works and sermons the reputation of the family for doctrinal
  theology.<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> His
  son&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Francis Sclater, B.D.</i> (Fellow of C. C. C. Oxon. May 17, 1667,
  æt. 17), was likewise a person of extraordinary learning and abilities,
  as appears from several notices, and more particularly from the
  inscription on a silver-gilt cup presented to C. C. C. in memory of him
  by his father; and from an elegant Latin epitaph which was placed on the
  south wall of St. James's, Clerkenwell.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> He died in 1685, æt. 35, leaving a
  son&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Christopher Sclater, M.A.</i>, born 1679, rector of Loughton in
  Essex, and afterwards of Chingford in the same county. His eldest
  son&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>William Sclater, D.D.</i>, seems (from MSS. still existing) to have
  inherited the theological talent of his ancestors, but o. s. p. Richard
  Sclater, Esq., the second son of Christopher, was grandfather to William
  Lutley Sclater, Esq., of Hoddington House, Hants, the present
  representative of the family. By a third son, Christopher Sclater was
  grandfather to Eliza Sclater, wife of &mdash;&mdash; Draper, Esq., and
  celebrated for her Platonic attachment to Lawrence Sterne. From MSS.
  preserved in the family, it is clear that she must have been a woman of
  considerable talent.</p>

  <p>I had always supposed <i>William Sclater</i>, the Nonjuror, and author
  of <i>An Original Draught</i>, &amp;c., to have been a brother of
  <i>Francis Sclater</i>; but, if it be true that his work was a posthumous
  publication (as I learn for the first time from the Note by the <span
  class="sc">Editor</span> of "N. &amp; Q."), I think it most probable that
  it was his father (the vicar of Collumpton above mentioned), who would
  have been about sixty years of age in 1688, and who was certainly a man
  of learning and scholarship.</p>

  <p>I have no doubt that Edward Sclater, the pervert of Putney, belonged
  to the same family, though I know not in how near relationship.</p>

  <p>The name of Sclater, which is curious, seems to have originated in a
  place called Slaughter (olim Sclostre or Sclaughtre, <i>temp.</i> King
  John) in Gloucestershire, where a family of Sclaughters flourished as
  lords of the manor for upwards of 300 years. The arms of both families
  are: arg. a saltier az.; crest, an eagle sa. rising out of a ducal
  coronet. The motto of the Sclater family (which they owe, no doubt to one
  of their learned ancestors) is a Greek quotation from Gal. vi. 14.:
  "<span class="gesperrt"><span title="ei mê en tôi staurôi" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F34; &mu;&#x1F74; &#x1F10;&nu; &tau;&#x1FF7;
  &sigma;&tau;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&#x1FF7;</span></span>."</p>

  <p>About the commencement of the seventeenth century, another branch of
  the same family (whose patronymic was Thomas) was settled in
  Cambridgeshire. The last male representative of these, Sir Thomas
  Sclater, Bart., died without issue in 1684 (see Burke's <i>Ext.
  Baronetages</i>).</p>

  <p>I should be glad of any information respecting the connexion of these
  two branches with each other, or of either with the parent stem in
  Gloucestershire. I should also be glad of information respecting one
  Will. Slatyer, D.D. (whose name is sometimes, I <i>believe</i>
  erroneously, spelt Sclater) a very learned person, chaplain to James I.,
  the <!-- Page 519 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page519"></a>{519}</span>author of some curious historical and
  genealogical works, and a celebrated Hebraist in those times. He was a
  cotemporary of Sclater of Pitminster, and died at Ottenden in Kent about
  the same time; but it is doubtful whether they were relations.</p>

<h3>BIRTHPLACE OF ST. PATRICK.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 344.).</p>

  <p>From the following extracts I send in answer to your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Ceyrep</span>, there seems to be very great doubt if St.
  Patrick ever existed in reality, but that we ought rather to place him in
  the same category with St. Amphibalus, St. Denis, &amp;c. Dr. Ledwich
  relates that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Usuard's, and the <i>Roman Martyrology</i>, Bishop Patrick, of
  Auvergne, is placed at the 16th day of March, and on the same day the
  office of the Lateran canons, approved by Pius V., celebrates the
  festival of a Patrick, the apostle of Ireland. The 17th of March is
  dedicated to Patrick, Bishop of Nola. Had not Dr. Maurice, then, the best
  reasons for supposing that Patricus Auvernensis sunk a day lower in the
  calendar, and made for the Irish a Patricius Hibernensis? This seems
  exactly to be the case. It is very extraordinary the 16th and 17th of
  March should have three Patricks, one of Auvergne, another of Ireland,
  and a third of Nola! The antiquities of Glastonbury record three
  Patricks, one of Auvergne, another archbishop of Ireland, and a third an
  abbot. The last, according to a martyrology cited by Usher, went on the
  mission to Ireland, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 850, but was
  unsuccessful: he returned and died at Glastonbury. If all that is now
  advanced be not a fardel of monkish fictions, which it certainly is, the
  last Patrick was the man who was beatified by the bigoted Anglo-Saxons,
  for his endeavours to bring the Irish to a conformity with the Romish
  church."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Aikin remarks upon this&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The author now ventures upon the bold attempt of annihilating St.
  Patrick. It is an undoubted fact, that this saint is not mentioned in any
  author, or in any work of veracity, in the fifth, sixth, seventh or
  eighth centuries. His name is in Bede's <i>Martyrology</i>; but it is
  more than probable that that martyrology is not Bede's: nor can it be
  conceived that Bede, in his other works, should never notice the signal
  service rendered by Patrick to the Roman church, and the signal miracles
  wrought by him in its behalf, if he had ever heard of them; for the old
  venerabilis was zealously devoted to that church and its mythology."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The saint certainly vanishes into "an airy nothing," if we are to
  credit the above authors. I have also consulted Ware, a Roman Catholic
  writer, author of the <i>Antiquitates Hibernicæ</i>, and nowhere can I
  find a trace of St. Patrick's birthplace, although he is frequently
  mentioned. In his seventh chapter he says, "Sancti præcipui Hibernici
  Seculi quinti, qui Euangelium in Hibernia prædicærunt, fuerunt Palladius,
  Patricius," and many others. The twenty-sixth chapter entitled
  "Monasteriologia Hibernica, sive Diatriba de Hiberniæ C&oelig;nobiis, in
  qua Origines eorum et aliæ Antiquitates aperiuntur," gives the names and
  titles of the founders of monasteries, as also their dates, and, in
  speaking of one of them, but in this case specifying no date, relates a
  curious circumstance as to the building of a church. It may perhaps
  interest your readers, and I will therefore quote the passage (p.
  212.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sanctus Patricius construxit hoc c&oelig;nobium Canonicis
  regularibus, eique præfecit Abbatem S. Dunnium: Ecclesiam verò adjecit
  (juxta Jocelinum Furnessensem), contra morem receptum, non ab Occidente
  in Orientem, sed à Septentrione in Austrum protensam."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This nevertheless hangs upon the reality of a St. Patrick. In another
  part of the same work it is said of a monastery (p. 219.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"S. Dabeocum fundâsse ferunt Seculo 5, vivente S. Patricio. Alii S.
  Patricium fundatorem volunt."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From these quotations it is clear Ware treated him as a real actor in
  Irish ecclesiastical affairs; but the two first-named authors appear to
  set the matter at rest.</p>

  <p><i>Cabal</i> (Vol. iv., p. 507.).&mdash;The two quotations from
  <i>Hudibras</i> evidently refer to two different meanings of this word
  <i>Cabal</i>. The first, alluding to the ancient Cabala, or Mysteries, or
  Secrets, from whence <i>Cabalistic</i>; the second, to its more modern,
  or political acceptation,&mdash;both, however, including the idea of
  <i>secrecy</i> or <i>privity</i>, as opposed to a general participation
  of knowledge or purpose. It is the latter application of the word to
  which the inquiry of E. H. D. D., at p. 443., Vol. iv., refers: and <span
  class="sc">Mr. Kersley</span>'s quotation from a book printed in 1655 (p.
  139., Vol. v.), proves its usage in this sense at least seven years
  before Burnet's derivation of the word from the initials of the five
  chief ministers of Charles II. I do not think that Pepys could use the
  word <i>Cabal</i>, as applicable to the "king's confidential advisers,"
  <i>several</i> years before Burnet derived it from their initials; the
  ministers in question having been appointed circa 1670. Burnet's
  definition was published in 1672, and Pepys was appointed Secretary to
  the Admiralty in 1673. Blount, in his <i>Glossographia</i>, 3rd edition,
  1670, says, "We use to say he is not of our <i>cabal</i>, that is, he is
  not received into our <!-- Page 521 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page521"></a>{521}</span>council, or is not privy to our secrets."
  Cole, in his <i>English Dictionary</i>, 1685, defines <i>Cabal</i>, "a
  secret council:" and Bailey derives <i>Caballer</i> from <i>cabaleur</i>
  (French), "a party man" and <i>To cabal</i>, from <i>cabaler</i>
  (French), "to plot together privately, to make parties;" and
  <i>Cabal</i>, from "a junto, or private council, a particular party, a
  set, or gang."</p>

  <p>I find among my papers a scrap relating to the derivation of the word
  <i>Whig</i>. I do not know where I took it from; but the origin which it
  gives to this much-used word is new to me, and may be to some others of
  your readers also:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The word Whig was given to the Liberal party in England by the
  Royalists in Cromwell's days, from the initial letters of their motto,
  'We hope in God.'"</p>

  doubtful whether the printer did have a copy bound in vellum as Junius
  directed, and they strengthen their doubts by, as they assert, no such
  copy having ever been met with. <span class="sc">Mr. Cramp</span>, on the
  contrary, maintains that such copies are so common that the printer must
  have taken the Junius copy as a pattern. As <span class="sc">Mr.

  will take leave to direct his attention to the question asked by V. B.
  (Vol. iii., p. 262.) Others, again, assuming that the printer did have a
  copy specially bound for Junius, think it doubtful whether it ever
  reached him. Of these differences and speculations your correspondent is
  evidently unaware; and he therefore raises a question as if it were new,
  which has been under discussion for thirty years. As a set-off, however,
  he favours us with an entirely original anecdote, so original, that
  neither the anecdote nor the tea-service were ever heard of by H. S.
  Woodfall's family. Yet it must be admitted that his story has all the
  characteristics of authenticity&mdash;names, dates, places. I know,
  indeed, but one objection, viz. that Mr. Woodfall never was "in prison on
  account of the publication of these redoubtable letters." He was tried,
  but <i>acquitted</i>, under the somewhat celebrated verdict of "guilty of
  printing and publishing <i>only</i>."</p>

  <i>cuddie</i> is the contraction of the very common name of
  <i>Cuthbert</i> (<i>teste</i> "Cuddie Headrig"); and that as the ass is
  called in other districts "Ned" and "Neddy," and in others again "Dick"
  and "Dicky," so he is called in Northumberland <i>Cuddie</i> by a name

  <p><i>Juba Issham</i> (Vol. v., p. 435.).&mdash;The signature is two
  names. The first needs no explanation; Juba, in <i>Cato</i>, is the lover
  of Marcia: the second may merely mean that the first is assumed, or
  false. We have such a surname as Isham, but it is spelt with one <i>s</i>

  <p><i>Bishop of London's House</i> (Vol. v., p. 371.).&mdash;In the
  <i>Wards of London</i>, by H. Thomas, 1828, vol. i. p. 7., we are told
  that&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The great fire of London having destroyed the Palace of the Bishop of
  London, which was near St. Paul's Cathedral, this house [Peter House,
  which stood on the west side, about the middle of Aldersgate Street] was
  purchased for the city mansion of the prelates of the diocese, one of
  whom only resided there, Bishop Henchman, who died there, and was buried
  at Fulham, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1675. It was then called London
  House, and, being subsequently deserted, was let out into private
  tenements until 1768; when it was entirely destroyed by fire while in the
  occupation of Mr. Seddon, an upholsterer and cabinet-maker."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A large brick building now covers the site, and retains the name of
  "London House." It is occupied by Mr. H. Burton, builder.</p>

  <p>In the work above quoted I find no mention of a residence of the
  Bishops of London in Bishopsgate. I therefore conclude that the one I
  have alluded to, is that respecting which your correspondent wishes to
  learn.</p>

  <p>"<i>Inveni Portum</i>" (Vol. v., pp. 10. 64.).&mdash;"Actum ne agas"
  is generally a safe motto, and a particularly safe one when so learned a
  scholar as <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> has preceded. However, it
  may do no harm to mention, that since the Query occurred in the "N. &amp;
  Q." I have met with two quotations of a very analogous kind.</p>

  <p>The first is given as a quotation, and may be found at the end of
  George Sandys' <i>Divine Poems</i>, 1648,&mdash;"Jam tetigi Portum
  &mdash;&mdash; valete." The second may be found amongst the <i>Poems</i>
  of Walter Haddon, and refers to something more ancient still:</p>

  <p><i>"Cane Decane," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. v., p. 440).&mdash;I cannot inform

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But I think that he has injured the spirit of the original in his
  "<i>free</i> translation."</p>

  <p><i>Decanus</i> means a "Dean," not a Deacon: and the word
  <i>canis</i>, which is both masculine and <i>feminine</i>, was often used
  by the poets in a <i>metaphorical</i> sense. It seems to me that the
  author was alluding to some aged <i>dignitary</i> of his day, who had
  been in the habit of singing songs upon <i>the ladies</i>. I therefore
  submit to you my <i>more free</i> translation:</p>

  <p><i>Fides Carbonarii</i> (Vol. iv., pp. 233. 283.).&mdash;In reply to
  <span class="sc">Querist</span> as to this saying, E. H. D. D. states
  that it originated in an anecdote told by Dr. Milner, or some other
  controversial writer. A coal-porter being asked what he believed,
  replied, "What the church believes:" and being asked what the church
  believed, replied, "What I believe."</p>

  <p>Now I find the same meaning given by Henry <!-- Page 524 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page524"></a>{524}</span>de Bellingen, in his
  <i>Etym. des Prov. Français</i>, printed at the Hague, 1656. His words,
  as quoted by Leroux de Lincy, are as follow:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On fait un conte qui a donné l'origine à ce proverbe. Un charbonnier
  estant enquis par le diable de ce qu'il croyait, luy respondit: 'Toujours
  je crois ce que l'église croit.' De là est venu que lorsqu'on a voulu
  marquer qu'un homme avait une foi ferme, mais sans science, on a dit: 'La
  foi du charbonnier.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Also, in P. J. Le Roux's <i>Dictionnaire Comique</i>, 1750:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>La foi du charbonnier.</i> Quand on parle d'une foi implicite, qui
  fait croire à un Chrétien en général tout ce que l'église croit."</p>

  <p><i>The Book of Jasher</i> (Vol. v., p. 415.).&mdash;I have a
  translation of a work thus named. It was published by Noah and Gould,
  144. Nassau Street, New York, 1840. The publisher's preface mentions
  Illive's work as "a miserable fabrication;" claims, as the original of
  his own, a book "said to have been discovered in Jerusalem at its capture
  by Titus," and preserved at Venice, 1613. It also speaks of the "owner
  and translator" as resident in England. I have a vague idea that I heard
  from New York, at the time I received my volume, that the Duke of Sussex
  had possessed a copy of the Book of Jasher, and that some steps had been
  taken towards the translation by order of His Royal Highness. I mention
  this merely to lead inquiry: I cannot trust my memory as to the verbal
  expression of a friend so many years ago.</p>

  <p>I have long wished the Book of Jasher to obtain a fair hearing, and a
  more critical examination than I am qualified to make; and I shall be
  happy to lend it to your correspondent L. L. L. in furtherance of what I
  think an act of justice.</p>

  <p><i>Sites of Buildings mysteriously changed</i> (Vol. v., p.

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Before whose erection the breadth and roughness of the river was
  such, as it put many in jeopardy: some were drowned, to the great grief
  of the inhabitants, who did therefore divers times, and in sundry places,
  begin to build a bridge; but no firm foundation, after often proof being
  found, their attempts came to no effect. At which time Sir Richard
  Gornard was priest of the place, who (as the story of that town hath it)
  was admonished by a vision in his sleep, to set on the foundation of a
  bridge near a rock, which he should find rowled from the higher grounds
  upon the strand. This he esteemed but a dream; yet, to second the same
  with some art, in the morning he found a huge rock there fixed, whose
  greatness argued it the work of God; which not only bred admiration, but
  incited him to set forwards so charitable a work: who eftsoons, with Sir
  Theobald Grenvile, knight, lord of the land, an especial furtherer and
  benefactor of that work, founded the bridge there, now to be seen, which
  for length, and number of arches, equalizeth, if not excelleth, all
  others in England," &amp;c.&mdash;Risdon's <i>Survey of Devon</i>, s. v.

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>We have received from Messrs. Rivington, four volumes of their new and
  complete edition of <i>The Works and Correspondence of The Right
  Honourable Edmund Burke</i>, and we do not know that a more valuable
  contribution could be made to our stores of historical and political
  literature, than this handsome collection of the writings of one whom Sir
  Robert Peel pronounced "the most profound of the philosophic statesmen of
  modern times." Dear to all lovers of literature as must be the memory of
  Burke, the friend of Johnson, who declared, "he was the only man whose
  common conversation corresponded with the fame which he had in the
  world," and of Goldsmith, who complained that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"He to party gave up what was meant for mankind;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and that he</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>... "too deep for his hearers still went on refining,</p>
      <p>And thought of convincing, while they thought of dining;"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>the present aspect of the political world compels us to look at him
  rather as a politician than as a man of letters. Considering, therefore,
  not only the profoundly philosophical character of his political works,
  but also the elevated tone of political morality which is displayed in
  the writings of Edmund Burke&mdash;a wisdom and a morality rendered still
  more attractive by the unrivalled eloquence with which they are
  enunciated&mdash;the present handsome and cheap collection of <!-- Page
  525 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page525"></a>{525}</span>those
  writings is alike creditable to the enterprise of the publishers, and
  well calculated to exercise a beneficial influence upon the political
  condition of the country. It would indeed be well if all who aspire to
  seats in the new parliament would fit themselves for such positions by a
  study of the writings of Edmund Burke.</p>

  <p>Mr. Willis has just issued a neat reprint of what has now become a
  very scarce volume, <i>The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</i>, a work which
  may be regarded as a model of political satire. It is accompanied by
  occasional notes elucidating allusions now become obscure through lapse
  of time, and the blanks in the text have been filled up with the names of
  the various persons introduced or alluded to. Some attempt has also been
  made to identify the various authors by whom the several articles were
  written; but we are surprised to find this so imperfectly executed, for
  when the editor speaks of the authorship being in many cases mere matter
  of conjecture, it is clear that he did not know of the very curious, and,
  we may add, authentic list, furnished to the third volume (p. 348.) of
  this journal by Mr. Hawkins of the British Museum; who has also given a
  history of the work, and of the manner in which it was conducted, which
  ought to have been made use of.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Legal Iambics in
  Prose, suggested by the present Chancery Crisis</i>, a quaint discourse,
  in which there is no small learning and humour, and to which may be
  applied, with some variation, Gay's well-known Epilogue:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Our pamphlet has a moral, and no doubt</p>
      <p>You all have sense enough to find it out."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>An Essay upon the Ghost Belief of Shakspeare</i>, by Alfred Roffe,
  is a little pamphlet well deserving perusal, in which the
  author&mdash;who holds that ghost belief, rightly understood, is most
  rational and salutary&mdash;endeavours to show that it must have had the
  sanction of such a thinker as Shakspeare.&mdash;<i>Rome in the Nineteenth
  Century, containing a complete account of the Ruins of the Ancient City,
  the Remains of the Middle Ages, and the Monuments of Modern Times</i>, by
  Charlotte A. Eaton. <i>Fifth Edition</i>, Vol. I., the new issue of
  Bohn's <i>Illustrated Library</i>, with its thirty-four engraved
  illustrations, will be found a very useful and instructive guide to the
  "Eternal City."&mdash;<i>The Heroides, the Amours, Art of Love, &amp;c.,
  of Ovid, translated</i> (with the judicious exception of the more
  questionable passages, which are left in the original Latin), forming the
  new volume of Bohn's <i>Classical Library</i>. In his <i>Standard
  Library</i> we have now the fifth and concluding volume of what has been
  well described as "the enthralling Biographies of Vasari." Thus for
  considerably less than one pound has the English lover of Art the means
  of possessing one of the most interesting and instructive works on the
  subject of his favourite study ever produced. The work deserves, and, we
  trust, will meet with a very wide circulation.</p>

  <p>In reviewing this Lexicon, the <i>Athenæum</i> says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In conclusion, we are glad to have an opportunity of introducing so
  excellent a work to the notice of our classical and philological readers.
  It has all that true German <i>Gründlichkeit</i> about it which is so
  highly appreciated by English scholars. Rarely, if ever, has so vast an
  amount of philological information been comprised in a single volume of
  this size. The knowledge which it conveys of the earlier and later Latin
  is not to be gathered from ordinary Latin Dictionaries.... With regard to
  the manner in which it is got up, we can speak most favourably. Every
  page bears the impress of industry and care. The type is clear, neat, and
  judiciously varied."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Literary Gazette</span> says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We have examined this book with considerable attention, and have no
  hesitation in saying it is the best Dictionary of the Latin language that
  has appeared."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Spectator</span> says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An elaborate fulness and completeness, while everything is quite
  clear, are the characteristics of this work,&mdash;rendering it the best
  Latin Dictionary for the scholar or advanced student."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Examiner</span> says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Dr. Andrews has a claim to our gratitude for his translation, not
  simply on the ground of his faithful retention of the excellencies of Dr.
  Freund, but also for much correction and some additions. In the 1663
  large 8vo. pages which form the volume before us, all the most valuable
  arrangements of detail have been compressed. It remains for us only to
  add that we never saw such a book published at such a price."</p>

  <p>A DICTIONARY OF ARCHAIC AND PROVINCIAL WORDS, Obsolete Phrases,
  Proverbs, and Ancient Customs from the reign of Edward I. By JAMES

  upwards of 1,000 pages closely printed in double columns, cloth
  1<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i></p>

  <p>It contains about 50,000 Words (embodying all the known scattered
  Glossaries of the English language), forming a complete key to the

  authors, whose works abound with allusions, of which explanations are not
  to be found in ordinary Dictionaries and books of reference. Most of the
  principal Archaisms are illustrated by examples selected from early
  inedited MSS. and rare books, and by far the greater portion will be
  found to be original authorities.</p>
